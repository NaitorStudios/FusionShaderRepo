		<description>(The effect comes from the Photoshop) Looks at each channels color information and multiplies the inverse of the blend and base colors. The result color is always a lighter color. Screening with black leaves the color unchanged. Screening with white produces white. The effect is similar to projecting multiple photographic slides on top of each other

                <description>(Only applies to Android and iOS!) This variable determines whether to use the newer background formatting. In Clickteam Fusion 2.5 for build 295.10 and earlier, the background texture was flipped along the Y axis, but this was changed in build 296.1. Check this option if you are using an older build!</description>
