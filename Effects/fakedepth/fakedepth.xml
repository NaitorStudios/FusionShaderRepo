<name>FakeDepth</name>
<description>This shader extracts depth information from the background texture and remaps it to create a fake depth-based coloring effect, where the foreground pixels are replaced with color values derived from the background's depth data. The effect simulates depth-based coloring by converting background pixel values into RGB components based on modular arithmetic, producing a pseudo-depth visualization.</description>
