<name>Mask: Sepia</name>
<description>Applies a sepia tone filter to images by converting them to grayscale and then blending that grayscale with sepia-colored values. The shader takes the average of the red, green, and blue channels, then multiplies the result by a sepia color vector to produce the final sepia-toned output.</description>
