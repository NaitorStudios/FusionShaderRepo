	<name>Krita Hard Mix Softer (Background)</name>
		<description>(The effect comes from the Krita) This is the Hard Mix blending mode as it is implemented in Photoshop for texturing brushes. It produces softer edges than the normal Hard Mix (Photoshop). This is like the Inverse Subtract mode but the two terms are scaled up to increase the contrast. This is not really a Hard Mix mode in the sense that it doesn’t choose between a result or another based on a threshold, although in most cases the result looks like the normal Hard Mix (Photoshop) but with softer edges.

                <description>(Only applies to Android and iOS!) This variable determines whether to use the newer background formatting. In Clickteam Fusion 2.5 for build 295.10 and earlier, the background texture was flipped along the Y axis, but this was changed in build 296.1. Check this option if you are using an older build!</description>
