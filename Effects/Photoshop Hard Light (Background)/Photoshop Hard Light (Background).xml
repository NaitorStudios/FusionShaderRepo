                <description>(Only applies to Android and iOS!) This variable determines whether to use the newer background formatting. In Clickteam Fusion 2.5 for build 295.10 and earlier, the background texture was flipped along the Y axis, but this was changed in build 296.1. Check this option if you are using an older build!</description>
