# FusionShaderRepo
Here's a collection of Clickteam Fusion shaders, at least half of it was either ported, improved, edited or made by me.
I'm listing and collecting all existing Fusion shaders. This obviously won't include private, paid, broken or WIP.

The files and information about them will be on http://dark-wire.com/

As a goal, I'll be porting and creating more shaders, making examples of usage (and perhaps a gif preview), and in the future a software to download, search and manage the shaders.

Foxioo Shader Pack is the only pack I would recommend downloading from the original source instead of separated files.
Reason being it has a nice folder structure and it's well maintained by the author.
You can download it here: https://github.com/FoxiooOfficial/FoxiooShaderPack/releases
